# 🙏 Bible Verse Finder: Bible Verse Encouragement from Emotion & Context

**Bible Verse Finder** is a spiritually-guided app that helps users center their thoughts and emotions on the Word of God. By inputting a sentence about how they feel or what they’re going through, users receive related Bible verses offering encouragement, wisdom, peace, and are encouraged to explore the context surrounding the verses.

---

## ✨ Why This Project?

In times of doubt, curiosity, anxiety, or even hope, we often struggle to align our thoughts with God’s truth. Bible Verse Finder is built to bridge that gap — providing a tool that reflects emotional and contextual understanding of the user’s input and anchors it in scripture.

---

## 🧠 Core Concept

**Input:**  
A user types a sentence reflecting their thoughts or feelings.

**Example:**  
> _"I’m nervous about my future and career."_

**Output:**  
- **Inferred Emotions:** anxious, uncertain  
- **Context Themes:** career, purpose  
- **Matching Bible Verses:**
  > “For I know the plans I have for you...” — *Jeremiah 29:11*  
  > “Trust in the Lord with all your heart...” — *Proverbs 3:5*

## 🙌 Inspiration

> “Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.”  
> — *Romans 12:2*

This tool was born from a personal desire to think more Godly in moments of doubt, distraction, and daily life. It is a reminder that scripture is living and applicable — even to the quiet thoughts we barely voice.
